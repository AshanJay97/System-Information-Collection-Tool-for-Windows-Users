# System Information Collection Tool

This project provides a tool to collect and manage detailed system information, save the data locally, and push it to a Firebase Realtime Database. The tool is written in Python and can be converted into an executable for running on devices without Python installed.

---

## Features
- **Collect System Information**: Gathers details such as device name, serial number, OS version, processor, RAM, disk capacity, logged-in users, installed software, and more.
- **Save to Desktop**: Saves the collected information as a JSON file on the user's desktop.
- **Push to Firebase**: Uploads the system information to a Firebase Realtime Database, uniquely identified by the deviceâ€™s serial number.
- **Silent Execution**: Runs without showing a terminal or PowerShell window (using `--noconsole`).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Git (optional)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/system-info-tool.git
cd system-info-tool
```

### Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

### Run the Script with Python
```bash
python system_info.py
```

### Convert to Executable
If you want to run the tool on devices without Python installed:
1. Install PyInstaller:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```
2. Convert the script to an executable:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole system_info.py
   ```
3. The `.exe` file will be available in the `dist` folder.

### Output
- The system information will be saved as a JSON file on the desktop with the filename format: `<Device_Serial_Number>_system_info.json`.
- The data will also be pushed to the Firebase Realtime Database.

## Firebase Setup
1. Create a Firebase Realtime Database.
2. Note the database URL (e.g., `https://your-project-id.firebaseio.com/`).
3. Replace the placeholder URL in `push_to_firebase` function with your database URL:
   ```python
   firebase_url = "https://your-project-id.firebaseio.com/system_info.json"
   ```
